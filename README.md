# Advent of Code 2022
This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). All of my solutions will be completed using C++.

Please don't look into this repository unless you want to spoil the challenge for yourself! However, if you've already completed a challenge and want to compare your solution with mine, go ahead and look!

My solutions will probably not be the most optimal as I am just doing this challenge for fun and to brush up on my programming skills. If you have any feedback from any of my solutions, feel free to reach out!

My goal is to finish all 25 days of the challenge and earn all 50 stars. I will update this README with my star count everytime I complete a challenge.

## Number of stars earned: 6/50 ⭐️
